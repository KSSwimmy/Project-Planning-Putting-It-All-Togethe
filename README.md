# WEEK 1

### Launching the planning phase video notes

The planning phase may differ from project to project, but generally three big things are worked out during this stage: 
- the schedule 
- the budget
- the risk management plan

**The schedule** is basically a timeline of the project. It includes the start date, the end date, and the dates for things that will happen in between. You will use time estimation techniques to determine these dates. 

**The budget** will account for the total cost to complete the project. The total cost needs to be broken down to determine how much has to be spent on different elements of the project.

The third component of the planning phase is **risk management**, which means searching for possible problems and planning ahead to mitigate these risks.

### Reflection: Project planning considerations

1. ***Write 2-3 sentences addressing what you should consider when forming the tentative project schedule.***

**A:** Did you consider these ideas in your schedule? When working through a potential schedule for a project, you should include several key dates. The dates may include important constraints from vendors, kickoffs dates, and when to complete certain tasks. Make sure to include a target date for the product (menu) launch, and validate that with the client. Remember, the schedule isn’t permanent. While you would like to stick to the schedule as closely as possible, it may change.

2. ***Write 2-3 sentences about what you should consider when creating a project budget.***

**A:** Did you consider these ideas in your budget? Call vendors and get quotes of items you may need to purchase. Include any pay for teammates or fees for outside consultants or service-based vendors. Include any software costs you may need to help you organize and manage your project. What if the project is delayed—are any fees associated with the delay?

3. ***Write 2-3 sentences on what you should consider when listing potential risks.***

**A:** Did you consider these ideas in your potential risks? Budget items that are likely to increase in cost. Think about days off for team members, and consider any holidays or vacation days. What about tasks and deliverables that could delay the project? Feedback from stakeholders could also cause delays.

### Facilitating a project kick-off meeting

A **project kickoff meeting** is the first meeting in which a project team comes together to ground everyone in a shared vision, gain a shared understanding of the project's goals and scope, and to understand each person's individual roles within the team. 

***So who's invited to the kickoff meeting?*** Well, that would be the team members identified in a RACI chart, created during the initiation phase. 

You should also invite your stakeholders and your sponsor to the meeting, so that they have a chance to understand the high-level plan for the project, can share their perspective, and you can ensure that everyone is on the same page. 

***Reasons to have a kick-off meeting:*** 
it's important to get together to **establish a shared vision,** **align on the scope**, and **build team rapport**. This is also an opportunity for teammates to **ask questions and offer insights**, and it's a great time for you to set expectations with the team about how each person will individually contribute to the project.

Kick-off meeting agenda 

- **introductions** 
- **Background** 
     - discussing how the project came to be and why the project matters 
- **Goals and scope** 
- **Roles** 
- **Collaboration**
- **What comes next**
- **Questions**

Once you've finalized the meeting agenda, document this information into a meeting agenda template, and send it to attendees a day or two ahead of the meeting. 

As the project manager, you'll be leading the majority of this meeting, and when you're presenting, it's difficult to take notes and present at the same time. So, at the start of the meeting, **ask a teammate to take notes** on key points you discussed throughout the session and to record each teammate's action items. 

In some cases, **it may be beneficial to record this meeting** so that attendees can revisit it later, especially if you have a large or dispersed team. Just be sure to get each attendee's permission to record ahead of time.

After the meeting, **don't forget to send a follow-up email to the group**, summarizing key points and outcomes from the meeting, as well as any action items to the attendees. In your follow-up email, be sure to also invite attendees to reach out if they have any additional questions.

### Reading: Tips for leading a successful kick-off meeting

In the previous video, you learned what a project **kick-off meeting** is and what it involves. As a reminder, a kick-off meeting is the first meeting among the project team, stakeholders, and the project sponsor at the start of a new project or new project phase. The purpose of a kick-off meeting is to ground everyone in a shared vision, ensure they understand the project’s goals and scope, and make sure that they are all on the same page about their roles and responsibilities on the project. The kick-off meeting is critical to a project’s overall success. It gets the team together to align on goals and visions for the project and sets the project up for success.

This reading will provide you with some tips for running an effective kick-off meeting. 

#### Kick-off meeting best practices

**Set the right time.** Choose a meeting time that works for everyone. Be mindful of time zone differences. 

**Set the right length.** Choose an appropriate meeting length—no more than one hour. You don’t want to waste people’s time, but you also don’t want to run out of time. Kick-off meetings work best when you first share key information and then spend any additional time on questions and team building.

**Invite the right people.** Be strategic about including the appropriate people. The goal is to invite attendees who play a role in the development and execution of the project, such as all team members, stakeholders, and the project sponsor. You don’t want to leave anyone out, but you also don’t want to invite people who shouldn’t be there.

**Designate a notetaker.** The discussion that takes place during the meeting is important. It is critical that you document any feedback, changes, or questions asked by attendees. If you are leading the meeting, designate someone else to take notes before the meeting starts. You can also use tools like Chorus Notetaker, Google Keep, Google Docs, or Microsoft OneNote.  

**Set the agenda.** To recap what we discussed in the video, a kick-off meeting agenda should generally include: introductions, the project background and purpose, project goals and scope, roles and responsibilities, the collaboration process and project tools, what comes next (expectations and action items), and time for questions and discussion.

**Share the agenda.** Prior to the meeting, share the agenda with attendees via email and identify speakers for each topic. By sending the agenda in advance, everyone will have an idea of what to expect, time to prepare for anything they may need to present or discuss, and time to generate questions or ideas.

**Stick to the agenda.** During meetings, discussions can sometimes go off topic or take longer than expected. As a project manager, it is your job to keep the meeting on track by redirecting discussions to the items on the agenda. 

Follow up after the meeting. After the meeting, make sure to send out a meeting summary featuring the meeting notes and any action items.

### Understanding tasks and milestone - video notes

A **project milestone** is an important point within the project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project.

A **project task** is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time. The work of a project is broken down into many different tasks. 

**In order to reach a milestone**, you and your team must complete multiple tasks. For example, if a milestone is completing the first draft of a report, the tasks required to get to that milestone might include hiring a writer, conducting research, and drafting different sections of the report. 

---

### The importance of setting milestones - Video Notes 

Setting milestones gives you a clear understanding of the amount of work your project will require. The act of setting milestones forces you to break your project down into more manageable chunks.

If you break that deliverable down into milestones and those milestones into tasks, you will have a better sense of the true amount of work that needs to be done. This will help you better manage the project workload. 

**Second reason milestones are so great** is that they can help keep your project on track. When you set a milestone, you assign clear deadlines for when certain project deliverables need to be completed. 

**A third reason** you'll want to set milestones is that they help you uncover areas where you might need to adjust scope, timelines, or resources to meet your goals.

Actually reaching milestones can seriously motivate your team and illustrate real progress to your stakeholders. With big projects that go on for months, you'll want to keep the teams motivation high. 

Milestones also serve as a great check-in point to highlight your progress to stakeholders. It gives them the opportunity to see the work that's been completed so far and lets them see everything is on track and up to their standards.

It's also important to remember that milestones must be completed on time and in sequential order because, usually, reaching the next milestone is dependent on completing a previous milestone.

### How to set milestones - video notes

The first step to setting a milestone is to evaluate your project as a whole. It helps to refer back to your project charter to remind yourself of the project goal. Then, make a list of what your team needs to do to achieve that goal. The big items that indicate progress are your milestones. These are the key points within the project schedule that signify the completion of a project deliverable or a phase in the project. 

Once you've determined your milestones, the next step is to assign each one a deadline. Reaching each of your milestones is dependent on the completion of multiple project tasks.

To get a good sense of timing, you can connect with teammates to discuss the tasks required to reach each milestone and get their estimates for how long these tasks will take. With those estimates in mind, you can make an informed decision about reasonable deadlines for each milestone.

When you set deadlines for milestones, you will also want to consider the needs of your stakeholders. 

Ask yourself when they'll expect to see a certain project deliverable, and consider the answer when choosing a deadline. Your stakeholders will want to see regular indications that the team is making progress, and milestones are a great way to show that progress.

### Setting milestones: Best practices

You have learned what milestones and tasks are and when, where, and how you will use them as a project manager. In this reading, we will explore best practices for setting milestones. But first, let’s revisit the definitions of tasks and milestones. 

- A **project task** is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time and is assigned to one or more individuals for completion. The work of a project is broken down into many different project tasks. 

- A **project milestone** is an important point within the project schedule that usually signifies the completion of a major deliverable. Milestones are significant checkpoints in your project, and keeping track of them helps ensure that your project is on schedule to meet its goals.

#### Set tasks to identify milestones

Setting tasks can help you clearly define milestones. You can do this in two ways:

1. **Top-down scheduling:** In this approach, the project manager lays out the higher-level milestones, then works to break down the effort into project tasks. The project manager works with their team to ensure that all tasks are captured.

2. **Bottom-up scheduling:** In this approach, the project manager looks at all of the individual tasks that need to be completed and then rolls those tasks into manageable chunks that lead to a milestone. 

Most projects have many tasks that lead to milestones. For instance, if your milestone is to receive approval on the first draft of an article that you are writing, you might complete tasks such as “develop outline,” “write first draft,” and “send to the editor.” Then, you may have another set of tasks to achieve before reaching the milestone of revising the article. Milestones serve as check-in points along your project to make sure that you are headed in the right direction toward the end goal. Milestones also make projects more manageable.

#### Milestone-setting pitfalls

Here are some things to avoid when setting milestones: 

- **Don’t set too many milestones.** When there are too many milestones, their importance is downplayed. And, if milestones are too small or too specific, you may end up with too many, making the project look much bigger than it really is to your team and stakeholders.  

- **Don’t mistake tasks for milestones.** Remember that milestones should represent moments in time, and in order to map out how you will get to those moments, you need to assign smaller tasks to each milestone.

- **Don’t list your milestones and tasks separately.** Make sure that tasks and milestones can be visualized together in one place, such as a project plan. This will help ensure that you are hitting your deadlines and milestones.

### Creating a work breakdown structure - video notes

A **work breakdown structure**, often abbreviated to **WBS**, is a tool that sorts the milestones and tasks of a project in a hierarchy, in the order they need to be completed. 

Tasks are typically assigned according to a person's role in the project.

To assign tasks between two or more team members with the same roles, you might take into consideration each person's familiarity with the tasks at hand.

One less obvious benefit of assigning tasks is that it creates a sense of personal responsibility for members of the team. When you assign a teammate to a task, you enter into an agreement with that person that they'll own the task until it's completed. Creating a sense of ownership for members of the team is important because it makes them feel more invested in the project. It also gives them space for personal growth. 

---

### Steps to build a WBS

As a reminder, here are three main steps to follow when creating a WBS: 

**Start with the high-level, overarching project picture.** Brainstorm with your team to list the major deliverables and milestones. Example: Imagine you are planning a company event. Your major milestones might include categories like “secure venue,”  “finalize guest logistics,” and “establish agenda.”

**Identify the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet those milestones.** Example: You could break a milestone like “secure venue” down into tasks like “research venues,” “tour and decorate space,” “make down payment,” and so on. 

**Examine those tasks and break them down further into sub-tasks. Example:** You could break down a task like “tour and decorate space” further into sub-tasks like “organize decorating committee,” “purchase decorations,” “assign decorating responsibilities,” and so on.

### Introduction: Building a project plan video notes

How project plan components are connected
You have learned that at the center of the project plan is the project schedule, which helps you estimate the amount of time it will take to complete the project and provides the team with a way to track the project’s progress against your goals. In addition to the schedule, you should also include the following components in your project plan: 

- Scope and goals

- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

- Budget 

- Management plans

### Making realistic time estimates

**Time estimation** is a prediction of the total amount of time required to complete a task. 

**Effort estimation** is a prediction of the amount and difficulty of active work required to complete a task. 

Effort estimation differs from time estimation in that effort quantifies the amount of time it will take a person to complete work on a task. On the flip side, time refers to the overall duration of the task from start to finish. That includes inactive time.

**Unrealistic effort estimates** this happens when you underestimate the amount of time it will take to complete a task. Often, the culprit for under estimating effort is optimism. 

Too much optimism can lead you to overlook potential risks that could set your plans behind schedule. 

Though it might be tempting to make the optimistic assumption that tasks will be executed exactly according to plan, there is always a possibility that there will be setbacks. 

**So, how do you try to avoid making unrealistic effort estimates?** You can do this by communicating with teammates assigned to each task. Your teammates will have the most realistic understanding of the amount of work required to complete a task and should be able to provide you with the best estimate.

A **buffer** is extra time added to the end of a task or a project to account for unexpected slowdowns or delays in work progress. Buffers are important because they can provide some leeway, just in case your time and effort estimates turn out to fall a bit short. **With a buffer, you can add extra time into your schedule, and your project shouldn't fall off track when task delays inevitably arise.** 

**There are two types of buffers** you can use when planning your schedule: **task buffers** and **project buffers**. First, we have task buffers, which refer to extra time tacked on to a specific task. Task buffers should be used primarily for tasks that are out of the project team's control. 

**Project buffers** differ from task buffers in that they provide extra time to the overall project schedule. Rather than adding a buffer to every task, you can add extra time as a buffer towards the end of your project schedule. Then you can use that extra time, two to three days, for example, as needed throughout the project.
